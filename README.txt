1. The Dashboad is submitted as a pbix file named Tracc Assessment in this repository

The below findings are the result of exploring the maturity_assessment_dataset.csv on a PowerBI Dashboard.
The dashboard utilises filters to manipulate the visuals.

- The most assessed practice is the 5S practice followed by the teamwork. While the least assessed being Leading and Managing Change practice across our clients.
- USA, German,France and china are the top four countries with most clients and hence our pracices are popular.
- Clients, 1,4,14, 44 are clientsthat have been assessed forall the tracc practices.
- Client 15's sites 122 and 62 and Client 38's site 110 are some of the clients with higher maturity assessement scores across all tracc practices, this might indicate an almost world class organisations.  
- Over the years the assessments trends on steady growth with a noteable high number of assessments in the third quarter overall.
